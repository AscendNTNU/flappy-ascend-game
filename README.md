# Flappy Ascend

This is a stand game to harvest our new recruits for our next years team.

## Explanation

This game reqiures one host server, and a lot of clients. The game works like this:

There are pins, which controlls who is playing where. Like Kahoot!

Go to /view/{pin} to watch the main event.
- Here you can find all players on the same pin.

Go to /play/{pin} to play on specified pin.
- You will not receive other players data as it causes a lot of traffic and delays.
